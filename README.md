 ## Websites
- [Akasoggybunz](https://akasoggybunz.website):  Website for more content reguarding my Youtube channel, and other hobbies. Just a Place I use to document my hobbies, intrests, code, electronics, and other stuff.
- [Updoots](https://www.updoots.com):  Website for saving useful internet sites. Kind of like pintrest, or the bookmark bar on your internet browser. I just needed a better way of organizing websites. This allows you to save them for later, share them as a group, and some more. Still in very early development. 
- [Updoots Adder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/updoots-adder/adfejilhcbenglgcdllkakdoppighbkc?hl=en-US):  Updoots Chrome extension for easily adding website while browsing the web.
